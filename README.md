Way of the Pig
==============
Way of the Pig is a Rust-based Dominion simulator.

It is inspired by [Geronimoo's DominionSim](https://github.com/Geronimoo/DominionSim). Way of the Pig emphasizes the following goals:
* Performance;
* Higher degree of customizability of AI algorithms;

And the following are currently non-goals:
* Card coverage, I will only implement a handful of cards.
* Ease of use. There will be no GUI nor customizable XML files, at least at this stage of development. Instead, everything will be modified through code.
